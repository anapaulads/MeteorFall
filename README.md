About The Project
MeteorFall was born as a solution for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, with the goal of transforming complex astronomical data into a visually impactful and accessible simulation. Our platform explores the "what if?" scenario, allowing anyone to understand the magnitude of an asteroid impact event anywhere in the world.

However, our true differentiator lies in connecting the physical simulation to the human response. MeteorFall incorporates a civil defense layer that transforms the experience: instead of just observing the impact, the user receives a simulated emergency alert, complete with actionable safety protocols based on real contingency plans. This turns a complex astronomical event into a powerful lesson on preparedness, resilience, and decision-making.
